# Covid-19-Project
In this project, we're delving into **COVID-19** data, particularly focusing on the impact of the virus across different countries and continents. We begin by filtering out incomplete data, ensuring that we're working with information from specific continents. Then, we conduct various analyses to glean insights.

First, we look at the relationship between total COVID-19 cases and deaths, particularly focusing on **Argentina**. We calculate the percentage of deaths concerning total cases, offering a perspective on the mortality rate in the country.

Next, we explore how the total cases relate to the population of a country. By calculating the percentage of the population infected with COVID-19, we gain insights into the virus's spread.

We also identify countries with the highest infection and death rates concerning their population, providing a comparative analysis of the pandemic's severity across different regions.

Furthermore, we examine global COVID-19 trends over time, analyzing daily new cases and deaths worldwide. This allows us to track the progression of the pandemic and understand its impact globally.

In addition to analyzing COVID-19 data, we also incorporate vaccination information. We calculate the percentage of the population vaccinated in various countries, offering insights into vaccination efforts.

Finally, we store our analyses in temporary tables and create a view for later visualization, ensuring accessibility and ease of use for further exploration and analysis.
